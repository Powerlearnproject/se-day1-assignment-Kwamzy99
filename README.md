Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It plays a significant importance in the technology industry as it drives innovation, is reliable and stable reducing the number of errors and crashes, efficiency and performance as it handles tasks faster with fewer resources, facilitates the development of scalable software and adaptability and offers protection against cyber threats.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
In the 1960s and 1970s, researchers and practitioners began to develop formal methods of for software design and development such as structured programming and use of flowcharts to represent algorithms.
Introduction of object-oriented programming which brought classes and objects which allowed for more modular and reusable code in the 1980s led to a shift in how software was designed and developed.
In the 1990s, there led to an emergence of agile methodologies which emphasized iterative development, adaptability and responsiveness to change.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements
-Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design
-Creating high-level and detailed design of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation
-Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing 
-Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment
-Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance
-Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In waterfall methodology, it follows a strict sequence of phases making it linear with requirements defined at the beginning and not expected to change with limited opportunities for customer feedback while in agile methodology, development is divided into small iterations called sprints with requirements and solutions evolving through collaboration and customer feedback and there is emphasis on adapting to changes.
Scenario for Waterfall methodology: Construction projects where there are no expected changes.
Scenario for Agile methodology: Startup companies where flexibility and quick iterations are crucial to adapt to market feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer
-Responsible for writing code, designing algorithms and implementing functionality based on requirements.
Quality Assurance Engineer
-Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager
-Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools allowing developers to write, compile, debug and test code more efficiently.
Example of IDEs; IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio

VCS are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members.
Example of VCS; Git, Mercurial

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight Deadlines
- Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and low quality.
- Strategy; Effective planning by breaking down tasks into manageable chunks and prioritize them based on deadlines.
Security threats
-There are constant cyber threats
-Strategy: Developers should follow best practices for secure coding such as encryption and perform regular audits.
Changing requirements
-This can lead to scope creep and project delays as it disrupts the development process.
-Strategy: Use of agile methodologies to accommodate changes.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing
-Involves testing individual components or functions of a software application in isolation to ensure they perform as expected.
Importance: Identifies bugs and ensures code quality.
Integration testing
-Focuses on verifying the interactions and data exchange between different components of a software application.
Importance: Detects interface issues, ensures data flow and enhances data reliability.
System testing
-Evaluates the overall functionality and performance of a complete and fully integrated software solution.
Importance: Validates requirements and covers both functional and non-functional aspects .
Acceptance testing
-This is where the software is evaluated to determine whether it meets the business requirements and is ready for release.
Importance: Ensures the software meets the needs and expectations of end-users and stakeholders and fulfills all business requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting questions/statements to guide generative AI models in producing desired outputs.
Importance with AI models: Prompt engineering is crucial for unlocking the full potential of AI by ensuring they deliver high-quality, relevant and user-friendly output.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example: 'Recipe for cake'
Improved example: 'Recipe for Carrot Cake with measurements in cups'
The improved prompt is effective as it is clear, specific and concise.
